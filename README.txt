Final project of Computer Architecture course (5th semester). 

Implementation of a MIPS architecture with pipeline in SystemVerilog.

The design supported R, I and J-type instructions as described in "Report.pdf". 

To verify its behavior, an addition-based multiplication algorithm was loaded to the instruction memory. The design supports signed multiplication as well. 

Simulation can be loaded in ModelSim software using mips_mult.do file.
